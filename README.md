## Code 
I the breif RMarkdown file, we try to explore the patterns of the network trafic in the organization. By doing so, we intend to tackle following questions:
1. How does the traffic distribute along hours of the day and along days of the week?
2. Are there any abnormal patterns we can highlight?
